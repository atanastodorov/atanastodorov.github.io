                            It said in the filing that it still hoped that 200 stores in the U.S. could be preserved in combination with its Canadian stores. It said is seeking a buyer for the Canadian operation.
                            The move came after Toys R Us told employees Wednesday that it is planning to sell or close all of its U.S. stores ahead of a court hearing scheduled for Thursday afternoon. It filed for bankruptcy reorganization late last year, but poor holiday sales and continued heavy debt forced its latest move.
                            "I am devastated that we have reached this point," CEO Dave Brandon told employees in a conference call, according to a tape of the call reviewed by The Record in Bergen County, N.J.
                            Brandon said Toys R Us found itself "in serious default on our financing covenants" after a disastrous holiday season. For Christmas 2017, earnings were about half of what the company might expect in a normal year.
                            The holiday results showed lenders that Toys R Us is "a company that consumes cash" for most of the year, and earns money only during the holidays. When the holiday period under-performed, investors became justifiably nervous, he said.
                            While U.S. operations are "subject to likely liquidation," Brandon said the Canadian, Central Europe and Asian divisions would be sold. At the court hearing, "There is going to be an invitation sent around the world that all of these assets are available."
                            If a buyer offers more than the liquidation value, there could be a sale.
                            Reports that Toys R Us was heading for a complete liquidation of its U.S. operations have been circulating for the past two weeks, with major news outlets citing sources familiar with the negotiations to keep the retailer alive.
                            In January, Toys R Us announced plans to close up to 182 of its U.S. stores, including 11 in New Jersey. It began going-out-of-business sales at those stores in February.
